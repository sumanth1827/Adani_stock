# Adani_stock
Continuing my journey on exploring the application of LSTMs, I attempted to predict stock market trends. The model was trained on adani nifty from 2010 to 2020 and was used to predict the 2021 market trend. All data was taken from kaggle.com. The results achieved show decent accuracy but the model can only predict only one day into the future, it uses this day to predict another day and so on. This is agreeably not a fully fair model and the results are not as impressive as it may seem through the graph. I wil be working on improving this model in the future.
